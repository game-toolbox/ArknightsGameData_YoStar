Your Grace:
I've successfully entered Londinium, and this was not done on impulse. As you've taught me, I'll never let personal emotions cloud my judgment, so please don't worry. I decided on this only after careful consideration.
I miss the days we spent together and the life we had at Lynncardine, but I'm sure I'll be more useful remaining here.
This place has more or less become the eye of a storm, accumulating momentum as news from all over Terra pours in rapidly. I'm sure I'll mature faster here. So you need not worry that I won't be polishing the skills I need, now that I'm far from Lynncardine.
Another thing: I ended up re-investigating the cause of Papa's passing, and he did indeed die from illness on his way back to Lynncardine after the meeting. Mum, I swear to you that this investigation into the truth behind his death will be my last self-indulgent act.
